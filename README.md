Lighthouse Finances | The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania; details my work as an investment banker in Lighthouse Finances for Knowledge@WhartonHighSchool Competition

Description - The Wharton Global High School Investment Competition is a free, experiential investment challenge for high school students (9th to 12th grade) and teachers. Students work in teams of four to seven, guided by a teacher as their advisor, and have access to an online stock market simulator. 

I was a member, in a team of 7, of Lighthouse Finances in Wharton's global investment competition, aiming to develop a virtual equity portfolio for a client, Ms. Reshma Sohoni.  We traded stocks over 2.5 months on their virutal online stock marktet simulator, becoming the Asian regionâ€™s highest reading team with ~ $4,500 profit at Infosys Campus, Bangalore.

We conducted in-depth analysis of economies and stock exchanges by developing a scoring system to study factors like demographics, core personal consumption expenditure, oil, etc. We also used fundamental ratios, technical and qualitative analysis to shortlist stocks for investing.
